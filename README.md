# job_applicator
Used to automatically apply to jobs using GPT3

This is proof of concept study looking to automatically generate cover letters and modified CV files for applying
to jobs using GPT-3 to understand the job listing and generate CV responses and cover letters.

After a bit of consideration I have decided to change this project mainly due to companies having individual
application portals.

instead I want to build this as follows. The input will be a job description url from indeed. The output will 
be a gpt 3 generated cover letter and optimised PDF.
